**PROJECT NAME:**
**Diagnostic Models for Heart Disease Prediction**


**PROJECT GOAL**

The aim of the present work is to predict whether a person with some particular 
characteristics, such as their cholesterol and the type of angina they experience, will 
develop a cardiovascular disease using data from a study conducted in the late 1980s by 
the Hungarian Institute of Cardiology (Budapest), the Zurich and Basel University Hospitals 
(Switzerland), and the Long Beach and Cleveland Clinic Foundation (Long Beach, United States of America).
